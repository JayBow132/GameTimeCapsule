        <h2>Cool Facts About Gaming</h2>
        <p>Did you know that the first video game ever created was the 1958 game "Tennis for Two"? It was a simple tennis simulation made for an oscilloscope. The game was designed by physicist William Higinbotham, who never profited from his invention.</p>
        
        <p>The gaming industry as we know it today started in the early 1970s with the release of arcade games like <i>Pong</i> by Atari. This marked the beginning of a cultural shift as gaming began to grow in popularity, reaching arcades and living rooms around the world.</p>
